UniStartupBoard makes it effortless for students to find each other and turn innovative ideas into real products—together.

(This was just a weekend MVP project as an MVP, but I do think there is a legitimate gap here)

The problem: University startup ecosystems are noisy and fragmented. 

Great ideas stall because:

-the one critical teammate (designer, ML person, biz dev lead) never crosses paths with the team that needs them,

-resources live in scattered group chats, newsletters, and dead forums, and

-students don’t see what’s being built outside their immediate friend circle or campus.

The result? 

Promising projects fail to reach escape velocity—not for lack of talent or ambition, but for lack of the right connection at the right time.

This is a matchmaking and discovery platform for student builders. 

It’s where you:

-Find co-founders and contributors who complement your skills at your school or in your city,

-Showcase what you’re building and what you need next,

-Discover projects across your campus—and nearby—that align with your interests.
